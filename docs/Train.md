This is the main method of the training. Here the training will be started, models can be loaded and/or evaluated.

Requirement for training:
    Make sure to have the dataset be available in subfolders sorted by their use. So the structure is as follows:    
        ../dataset/Train
        ../dataset/Valid
        ../dataset/Test
